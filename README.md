# Video Post Production Helper - February 2026

Week 2 Video Post Production Workflow Tool

🔗 **Live Demo**: https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/feb2/

## Project Overview

This project implements a structured methodology for video post-production workflows, organized using a 7-phase approach from unknown problems to validated solutions.

## 7-Phase Methodology

### [1_Real_Unknown](1_Real_Unknown/) - Objectives (OKRs)
Defines project objectives and key results. Start with the unknown problem: streamlining video post-production workflows.

### [2_Environment](2_Environment/) - Roadmap and Use Cases
Contains the project roadmap with development phases and detailed use cases for different user scenarios. Includes reference input files.

### [3_Simulation](3_Simulation/) - UI Examples
User interfaces and technologies used, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PrismJS for syntax highlighting.

### [4_Formula](4_Formula/) - Guides and Best Practices
Step-by-step formulas and guides built by GPT for parsing, transforming, and validating post-production data.

### [5_Symbols](5_Symbols/) - Core Source Code
Contains the main application files including the post-production helper HTML application.

### [6_Semblance](6_Semblance/) - Error Logs and Solutions
Documents common issues, their causes, and solutions. Includes debugging tips and browser compatibility notes.

### [7_Testing_known](7_Testing_known/) - Validation
Contains test plans, validation procedures, and acceptance criteria. Tests reach from unknown problem back to known, validated solution.

## Quick Start

1. Open [5_Symbols/postproduction_helper.html](5_Symbols/postproduction_helper.html) in a web browser
2. Upload your project files (YAML, JSON, SRT, Markdown, EDL)
3. View syntax-highlighted content
4. Copy, download, or transform your data

## Features

- 📁 Multi-file upload support (drag & drop enabled)
- 🎨 Syntax highlighting with PrismJS
- 📋 Copy to clipboard functionality
- 💾 Download processed files
- 🔍 Parse YAML, JSON, SRT, and Markdown
- ⚡ Real-time preview and validation

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting
- [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) for YAML parsing
- FileReader API for file handling

## Development Workflow

This project follows the 7-phase methodology:

1. **Real** → Identify unknown problem
2. **Environment** → Define use cases and requirements  
3. **Simulation** → Design UI and interactions
4. **Formula** → Build processing algorithms
5. **Symbols** → Implement source code
6. **Semblance** → Handle errors and edge cases
7. **Testing** → Validate against objectives (reach known proof)
